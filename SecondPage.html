    <h2>AATROX - KING OF THE DARKIN BLADE</h2>
    <p>Aatrox was his name. He was at the vanguard of every noble conflict. So true and just was his conduct that other
        god-warriors would always gather at his side, and ten thousand mortals of Shurima marched behind him. When
        Setaka, the Ascended warrior-queen, called for his help against the rebellion of Icathia, Aatrox answered
        without hesitation.</p>
    <p>
        But no one predicted the extent of the horrors that the rebels would unleash—the Void quickly overwhelmed its
        Icathian masters, and began the grinding annihilation of all life it encountered.
    </p>
    <p>After many years of desperate battle, Aatrox and his brethren finally halted the Void’s perverse advance, and
        seared the largest rifts shut. But the surviving Ascended, the self-described Sunborn, had been forever changed
        by what they had encountered. Though Shurima had triumphed, they all had lost something in their victory... even
        noble Aatrox.</p>
